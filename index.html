            <p class = "about">I am a student at the <a href = "https://www.uic.edu"> University of Illinois at Chicago </a>,

            <p class = "about bio"> I like programming, which is a valuable skill for anyone to have as it bolsters our thinking abilities
                and helps us come up with clever solutions to complex problems. As an extracurricular activity,
                i am currently learning various technologies used in fullstack web development. I also like to take part
                in competitive programming challenges in my free time to further develop my problem solving and
                programming skills.</p>

                <h3> Programming </h3>
                <p> I started to code when I was 17. After 4 years now, I have developed a sound understanding of various
                    programming constructs and I like to implement my solutions in languages like C++, Java, Python and
                    many more. </p>
